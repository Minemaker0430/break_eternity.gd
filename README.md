# break_eternity.gd
A port of [Patashu](https://github.com/Patashu)'s [break_eternity.js](https://github.com/Patashu/break_eternity.js/), for Godot projects!

This library currently contains most functions from break_eternity.js (excluding alias functions and easter eggs, and fromString() because of its complexity) 
Some stuff may be slightly broken or incomplete, I tried my best to port everything I could correctly.

If you're a more experienced Godot programmer than I am and notice something that could be improved upon or fixed, don't hesitate to open a PR!

Thanks :)
